<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


Vue.js project with skeleton state profile card
<br><br>
 
 <strong>Brief Description about the project
 <br>
This Vue.js project features a profile card component that displays a skeleton state while the data is being fetched. Once the data is fetched, the component renders the data in the profile card.

This provides a better user experience by showing the user that the data is being loaded, rather than displaying a blank page. It also makes the project feel faster, as the user does not have to wait for the entire page to load to see the profile card.

The project is built using Vue.js, which is a popular framework for developing web applications. It is also responsive, so it can be used on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
